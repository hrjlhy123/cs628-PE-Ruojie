# Input
The user provides two inputs: (1) selecting a genre from the dropdown menu to filter the movie list, and (2) clicking on a movie to trigger an alert showing its title. The initial movie data is defined as a static array of movie objects, each containing a title, genre, and release year.

# Process
The application processes user actions using React state and hooks. When a genre is selected, the app filters the movie array to show only movies matching the genre, or all if "All Genres" is selected. When a movie is clicked, an event handler reads the movie title and displays it in an alert box. Reactâ€™s functional components and JSX dynamically render the filtered list and handle state updates efficiently.

# Output
The app displays a styled, interactive list of movies with their details. Filtering updates the displayed list, and clicking a movie shows an alert with its title.
