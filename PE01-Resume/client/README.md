# Input
The Resume web application does not require user input during runtime. Instead, the input is hard-coded in the React component as personal details, educational background, and project descriptions. These static inputs include name, contact information, degrees, GPAs, and project links.

# Process
The React application processes the static data by rendering it into structured HTML elements. It uses a `Resume` functional component and styled CSS classes to format and display each section - header, education, and projects - with consistent styling and layout. No dynamic computation is performed.

# Output
The output is a styled, responsive web page displaying the user's resume. It shows the personal header, a list of educational qualifications, and a list of projects with descriptions and placeholders for links. The output is viewable in a browser as a readable resume.
